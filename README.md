## Food
* Diva eats *1 bowl of food per day*.
* You can put a treat in her bowl when you put the food there. Do give her dog treats.
* Do feed her before you eat. She may not eat it, but the food should be there. This is according to the Jewish law, which I try follow.
* Do feed her cut up carrots and cucumbers. She can also have 1 hard boiled egg per day (at most).

## Do's
* Play with Diva.
* Train Diva - with her known tricks (see Tricks section) and you can train her to do _new tricks_!
* Take her out for walks. She prefers grassy areas, FYI.
* Take her to dog parks and release her (keep an eye on her though, unfortunately not all dogs get along with her)
* Give encouraging feedback when she does something good, such as "Good girl!" and generally anything that is said with a smile and a happy tone. Dogs can sense our feelings.
* Pick up her feces. Please keep the sidewalks clean (also, avoid the 475 NIS fine).

## Don'ts
* Do not feed her at the table or give her Human food. 
* Do not give her chicken or meat if it was cooked with spices, or chocolate/cookies/cakes/etc.
* Do not punish her if you catch her after she did something, only if you catch her during the act!
* Do not let her on a bed or on the couch!

## Tricks & Commands
* `Sit` – The most basic command. If Diva ever gets out of hand or too excited for whatever reason - this is the command to use first. She knows this one the best and will sit in any situation.
* `Down` – Diva will lie down. She is more likely to listen if she was sitting first.
* `Stay` – Diva will stay where she is. It’s more likely she will listen if you first tell her to sit or lie down.
* `Come` – Diva will come to you.
* `Out` - Diva will exit the room. You can repeat this command a few times if necessary, she will eventually understand.
* `Play dead` – Diva is much more likely to listen if she was lying down, and only if she’s calm. She should lie down on her side and not move.
* `Back` or `Go back` – sometimes it’s necessary to repeat this. She should take a few steps back. You can continue this by saying `more` afterwards.
* `Paw` – she will give you her right paw. 
* `Other paw`  - she will give you her left paw.  * `Turn around`- Diva will turn around 360 degrees in place.
* `Jump` – Diva will jump. Usually useful for when you tell her to sit, and you hold something up in the air. Then you can tell her to jump when you want her to get it.
* `Fetch!`, `Get it!`, `Go!` – Diva will go get whatever you just threw. She does this normally without a command, but if you want, you can tell her to stay, then throw something (and possibly repeat `stay` once more), and then tell her to `fetch` it when you want her to `go get it`.
* `Let Go` – Diva will let go of whatever is in her mouth. Lately, she doesn’t listen to this as much and to just anyone, since it’s over-used and repeated too often. Try offering her a treat the first few times you tell her, or offering her a different toy/ball than the one she has. This should get her listening to you in no time, and letting go of what she has.
* `Put it in my hand` – hold out your hand and say this. She will put the toy in your hand. if she misses, then don’t pick it up – keep your hand there and repeat the command – she will stop being lazy and she will try harder ☺
* `Bring it to me` - sometimes, after Diva gets a ball/toy you just threw, Diva won’t come right back to you and will walk/run around with the ball. This will tell her to come give you the toy, and she almost always listens to this command.
* `Track it` – this is ‘experimental’. It’s a fun one though ☺ 
* `Heel!` – Diva will ‘heel’ when walking. You will need to walk with a treat in your hand the first few times (without giving it to her till much later in the walk), until she gets used to you. If she tries to walk ahead of you, you can also say `Hey!` quickly and she will take a step back.
* `NO!` – this is the one command that diva knows means she should stop whatever she’s doing, and that she is doing something bad.
* `Enough` – Diva will usually calm down after you tell her enough. It’s almost like ‘NO’, but less negative.
* `Drink` – Diva will drink her water. You can tell her to sit before you pour her water, and then tell her to drink when you’re done so that she can start drinking (without bothering you while you pour).
`Eat` – Diva may eat her food. Same as above. You can try to get her to eat by repeating this a few times if she doesn’t have an appetite. 
* `Go to bed` - Diva will go to her bed. If she has a blanket, she will go to the blanket. When it’s time to go to sleep, you can tell her to go to bed… and she will listen ☺


## Mixins 

Try mixing up `paw` and `fetch`, you’ll see her thinking and trying to get it right, it’s very cute. Make sure to reward her when you do this (e.g. "paw, paw, other paw" = treat if she got them all right).

Basically, if you have a ball, tell her to come to you and lie down. Then tell her to stay, and cover her eyes with your hand and tell her again to `STAY`. Then throw the ball. Uncover her eyes and tell her to `track it` and enjoy watching her search! She loves this too, since it’s a challenge for her but she will almost always find it. This is a healthy exercise for her because it exercises her mind.

## Examples
